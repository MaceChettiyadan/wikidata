## How to use
To use, download the zip (button above) and extract it into a new folder.
Navigate to this folder in the terminal by typing `cd` followed by the path to the folder.
In the folder, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.
Then type `python src/main.py` to run the program.
Make sure to smash that review button.

### If it doesn't work
1. Make sure you are in the right directory. Extracting a zip usually results in an identically named folder within another. Make sure you are in the inner folder.
2. You may not have python or pip. If you do not have python, go to the website and download it. If you have python (can be tested by typeing `python` in the command line) but not pip, type `python -m ensurepip --upgrade` in the command line.
